This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in R related to data frame subsetting. When using character vectors to select columns, R's partial matching behavior can lead to unintended consequences if column names share prefixes.  The `bug.r` file illustrates the problem, and `bugSolution.r` shows a corrected approach.  The issue stems from R's default behavior when subsetting, where partial matches are allowed. This can cause incorrect column selection when column names are similar. The solution highlights the importance of employing exact matching techniques to avoid these pitfalls.
